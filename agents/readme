stats-lab agent entrypoint
==========================

Before any work on this repository, read the root `AGENTS.md` first.

Operational rules:
- Always generate or refresh data through `scripts/` and `Makefile` targets.
- Never hand-edit files under `data/`.
- If data content must change, update generator code and regenerate.
- Keep random seeds explicit and fixed for reproducibility.

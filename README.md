# stats-lab

`stats-lab` is a reproducible playground for learning statistics with realistic synthetic data.
The generated data intentionally includes skew, missing values, outliers, and small embedded effects for testing.

## Directory Layout

- `data/`: Raw data area (do not hand-edit)
- `notebooks/`: Scratch space for analysis and learning
- `src/`: Reusable helper functions and small modules
- `reports/`: One-figure + one-line report artifacts
- `scripts/`: Reproducible generation commands
- `agents/`: Agent operation entrypoint

Synthetic files generated by this repo are saved in `data/synthetic/`.

## Quick Start

```bash
make data
```

This generates lightweight sample CSVs into `data/synthetic/`.

## Data and Reproducibility Rules

- `data/` is edit-prohibited.
- If you want different data, change generator code in `scripts/` and regenerate.
- Keep seeds fixed by default; make seed changes explicit.
